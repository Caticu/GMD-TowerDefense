I will continue talking about my progress.

Things are getting tough, as I have a lot of deadlines.

I am giving up on spline I do not understand and know how to use it. I am reverting  to checkpoint for movement. 
Because I restructured the code using solid principles, I only have to create a new interface and implementation, then on the wolf object just use those instead. That's very cool.
I fixed everything now, wolf and archer work properly right now. 
I'll look into the bullet component and check if I have to change it as well to follow solid principles.
I created prefabs for troll, snake and mage tower and Aoe tower. 
I did the same for bullet types.

Set-up object pooling for monsters, towers and bullets.

Created canvases for building a tower, upgrading a tower, sound on or off, start the game, gold and lives.
Then for each one, I created a manager handling different parts.
